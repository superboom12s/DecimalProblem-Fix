# Python-decimal-problem-fix

This library fixes the python decimal problems when adding or substracting numbers.

An example of a decimal problem is 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004, its obviously 0.3 but python says that is 0.30000000000000004. This library fixes that; when using the library funtion it will always return the correct result.
