# Python-decimal-problem-fix
This will fix float addition results in Python 3.

This will fix the result of every float adition, for example, pyrhon says that 0.1 + 0.2 is equal to 0.30000000000000004, thats not right but my program can fix that, just use the comand sum(number one, number two) example: sum(0.1 + 0.2) returns 0.3.
